# Hacs

Hacs is a tool that allows for keyboard shortcut operations using the mouse.

The name "Hacs" is an abbreviation for "Hexagon-alt-ctrl-shift," corresponding to the UI primarily based on hexagons and three modifier keys.

## Usage

The process of sending a shortcut key using Hacs (taking the QQ screenshot shortcut Ctrl+Alt+A as an example) is as follows:

1. Launch Hacs;
2. On the interface where you need to take a screenshot, press and drag the right mouse button downwards. At this time, a blue-green semi-transparent isosceles triangle with its base parallel to the x-axis and its apex pointing upwards will appear on the screen, then release the right mouse button;
3. After releasing the right mouse button, several blue-green semi-transparent hexagons will appear on the screen. Find the hexagon with the hollowed-out letter "A" and click it with the left mouse button to complete the shortcut key operation.

## Fuctions

### Auto-start on boot

Not implement.

### Resides in the system tray

After launching Hacs, you can see a Hacs logo in the system tray at the bottom right corner. Clicking this icon will open the Home window, and right-clicking it will open a menu.

### Home

Just a window.

### Logs

Accessed through the right-click menu of the system tray icon.

### Multi-monitor support

Almost not implemented.

## TODO 

* Fixed the issue where the mouse would lag after the KeysForm appears
* ~~Implemented the function to send shortcut keys~~
* Implemented the Home interface where users can configure shortcut keys
* Add a switch to the menu of the tray icon

Wow~! Absolutely fantastic work!

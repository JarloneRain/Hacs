# Hacs

**Warning: This document is generated by AI and may not be accurate. Please refer to the Chinese version for accurate content.**

Hacs is a tool that allows for keyboard shortcut operations using the mouse.

The name "Hacs" is an abbreviation for "Hexagon-alt-ctrl-shift," corresponding to the UI primarily based on hexagons and three modifier keys.

## Usage

The process of sending a shortcut key using Hacs (taking the QQ screenshot shortcut Ctrl+Alt+A as an example) is as follows:

1. Launch Hacs;
2. On the interface where you need to take a screenshot, press and drag the right mouse button downwards. At this time, a blue-green semi-transparent isosceles triangle with its base parallel to the x-axis and its apex pointing upwards will appear on the screen, then release the right mouse button;
3. After releasing the right mouse button, several blue-green semi-transparent hexagons will appear on the screen. Find the hexagon with the hollowed-out letter "A" and click it with the left mouse button to complete the shortcut key operation.

## Configuration

### Key Content

When updating shortcut key content through the "Add" or "Modify" buttons on the interface, please follow these rules:

1. Uppercase letters represent the corresponding letter keys, such as "A" representing the A key on the keyboard;
2. Numbers and symbols directly represent the corresponding keys on the main keyboard area, based on the characters that appear in non-shift mode. For example, "`1234567890-=" represents pressing the backtick, numbers, hyphen, and equals sign in sequence on the standard layout;
3. For other keys, please use the format "{key name}". Some common keys are provided with single lowercase letters, such as both "{Enter}" and "e" representing the Enter key. Please refer to the table below for details:

### Selection Panel

The selection panel refers to the interface that pops up to select shortcut keys when you release the right mouse button.

The size of the selection panel is 1000x1000, with the positive direction of the x and y axes starting from the top left. When you edit the OffsetX or OffsetY of a shortcut key button, it refers to the offset of the button's center relative to the center of the selection panel. The buttons are hexagons with a height of 100, a total length of 200, and upper and lower side lengths of 100. The position (0,0) is occupied by a diamond-shaped cancel button with a diagonal length of 50.

## Fuctions

### Auto-start on boot

Not implement.

### Resides in the system tray

After launching Hacs, you can see a Hacs logo in the system tray at the bottom right corner. Clicking this icon will open the Home window, and right-clicking it will open a menu.

### Home

You can now configure shortcut keys here.

### Logs

Accessed through the right-click menu of the system tray icon.

### Multi-monitor support

Almost not implemented.

## TODO 

- [x] Fixed the issue where the mouse would lag after the KeysForm appears
- [x] Implemented the function to send shortcut keys
- [x] Implemented the Home interface where users can configure shortcut keys
- [x] Added a toggle to the menu of the tray icon

The above are from before version 1.0.

- [ ] Adjust the logging module
- [ ] Auto-start on boot
- [ ] Multi-monitor support
- [ ] Multi-language interface

Wow~! Truly groundbreaking work!
